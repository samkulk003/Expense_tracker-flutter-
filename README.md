# Expenses_tracker

A new Flutter project.

## Expense Tracker - Your personal budget manager.

Introducing my Expense Tracker App, an intuitive and comprehensive tool designed to simplify personal finance management. This app caters to anyone who seeks better control over their financial health, helping users track their expenditures in an efficient and straightforward manner.

The core features of my Expense Tracker include the ability to categorize different types of expenses, record their costs, and note the date of each transaction. My user-friendly interface makes it easy to enter, view, and manage your expenses. Furthermore, the app gives you the freedom to delete entries or undo actions, offering flexibility in maintaining accurate financial records.

Noteworthy is my responsive design which ensures a smooth user experience on any device. The app also comes with a dark mode setting, reflecting my commitment to provide comfort for users in different lighting conditions.
